CHANGES file for Test::Verbose


    - Runs a .tvrc file in the project's root directory before any tests
      are run.  This allows you to set env. vars, for instance.

    - Added John Fetkovich's elisp code to map the tv command to a key
      in a .emacs file.
    - Don't chdir to the project dir until running make test so that
      podchecker and perl -cw can find files.
    - Don't prepend t/ to absolute test script paths
    - Only run POD checks in a source file if POD detected (/^=/ matches)
    - look for t/ or lib/ when scanning up, to handle projects with
      no t/.  Ideally, this would search for t/ because lib/Foo/lib/...
      might be present, but hey, this is BALGE for now.
    - Prevent infinite looping if no project dir found.
    - tolerate \s before ; in packages decls
    - Don't examine $project_dir/lib/..., $project_dir unless a package
      name is supplied.

    - -d, --debug runs the test scripts in the debugger in NonStop mode
